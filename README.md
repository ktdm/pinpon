# pinpon

A slang translation website.

## What is this

This git project contains the (*currently unfinished*) code for a multi-language, user-submission-based and user-rated translation website. It is written on the Ruby on Rails framework and currently hosted at [pinpon.herokuapp.com](http://pinpon.herokuapp.com).

## How to translate a word

First, select the source and target languages and submit. (The language of the word you already have is the source language, while the language you want to translate it to is the target language.) Next, begin typing your word in the "Search word" field until it appears on the page. If it doesn't appear, you can submit your own best translation to pinpon.

Clicking on your word will take you to a list of translations, with the most upvoted words appearing at the top. Each translation may come with an explanatory comment, which can also be voted on by clicking "See explanations". If you know of a better translation than those displayed, you can submit it by clicking "Add a translation". Related words may appear at the end of the page grouped by how they are related, and can be submitted by clicking "Add a suggestion".
